# Technical Projects

## Multi-Agent Reasoning System
**LangGraph · LLAMA 2/3 · Case-Based Reasoning**  
Developed state-of-the-art reasoning workflow using LangGraph that matches o1-mini performance with 3x API cost reduction. Implemented interpretable case-based reasoning and automated index generation using LLAMA 2-70b/LLAMA 3-70b. Deployed on HPE Cray EX clusters (Big Red 200) with Python/C++ implementations.  
*Key Achievement: 60% improvement in case-base quality through meta-prompt engineering*

## Alzheimer's Diagnostic Framework
**PyTorch · Transformers · GRAD-CAM · HPC**  
Led development of interpretable transformer models integrating MRI imaging and genetic data for Alzheimer's diagnosis (84.6% accuracy). Implemented GRAD-CAM for model interpretability (15% performance boost) and optimized distributed training on Big Red 200 HPC clusters.  
*Key Achievement: 40% reduction in training time via parallelized data loading*

## Biomechanical Analysis Suite
**PyQt5 · MoveNet · SiamMask · Plotly Dash**  
Created multi-threaded PyQt5 application for synchronized deep learning-assisted biomechanical analysis of video streams. Enhanced object tracking with Kalman Filter-augmented SiamMask and developed MoveNet-inspired keypoint estimators. Visualized streaming data with real-time Plotly dashboards.  
*Key Achievement: Secured $100,000 ArtPark IISc funding*
